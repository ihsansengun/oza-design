A peaceful sanctuary feeling and emotional design are applied to the design with ultimate sophisticated detailing.\n\nThe house is invisible from the bustling street, behind a door framed by a distinctive classical stone portal, that was a hidden gem at the heart of Chelsea. As soon as you enter, you are taken to a tranquil oasis, far from the commotion and clamour of the surrounding metropolis.",

Built circa 1900, the house features coloured brick and wood, a pitched roof, bay windows and a fireplace in every room which adds instant charm.\n\nIts location in Battersea, South West London, was the main source of inspiration. This is reflected in the kind of living environment created by those who lived during the Industrial Revolution. Our aim was to bring the dark industrial past into the background by designing a house that exudes lightness, calmness and serenity.",

    description: "Richmond Theatre stands as a testament to the stunning architecture of the late 19th century. It was designed by the renowned theatre architect, Franck Matcham, and opened its doors in 1899.\n\nWith its iconic symmetrical layout and elegant red brick and terra cotta façade, the twin towers with cupolas, baroque centre piece with arched entrance below a scrolled pediment, it has become a Grade II listed building by Historic England. Interestingly, Richmond Theatre is the third theatre to have been built on the site, with the first one opening all the way back in 1718.",

Historically, the Silk Road served as the main conduit connecting these two worlds, with saffron being one of the primary spices traded. Inspired by this, we crafted bespoke colors for the walls using saffron pigments and engaged a remarkable artist to apply textured clay, mimicking the feel of saffron spice—soft and delicate to the touch.",

    description: "The Grand Opera House in York is a stunning building with a fascinating history. Originally constructed in 1868 as a Corn Exchange and Warehouse, it was later transformed into a theatre in 1902. However, in 1958, the stalls boxes and stage were removed, and the space was repurposed for roller-skating, dance, bingo, and wrestling. It was renamed as the SS Empire, and it remained this way for almost thirty years. Fortunately, in 1987, the theatre was finally restored to its original function and design, providing audiences with an exceptional theatrical experience.\n\nŌZA had the honour of being selected as the interior designer for the Grand Opera House York renovation. The main auditorium, foyer, bar, as well as the places where performers get ready for performances, like dressing rooms and bathrooms, were all upgraded by our team. Our main objective was to respect the theater's rich history and bring back its distinctive character to its former splendour.",

In response to the monolithic and contemporary initial brief, this project offers a theatrical interior and a unique monochromatic appearance.\n\nFunctioning both as a store and a gallery, this space immerses visitors in a sculptural sanctuary. It is characterised by a modern, clean-cut, radical aesthetic that promotes spirituality and fosters conversations on temporary exhibitions.",
